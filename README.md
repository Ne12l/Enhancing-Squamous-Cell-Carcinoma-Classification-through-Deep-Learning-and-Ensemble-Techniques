This project focuses on improving the classification accuracy of Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) through 
the application of advanced deep learning models and ensemble techniques. The study utilizes the Herlev 
dataset, comprising a total of 917 images, encompassing both multi-cell and single-cell samples. The 
dataset undergoes a series of preprocessing steps, including image acquisition, normalization, and 
enhancement using techniques such as Clahe, Median filter, and NLM filter. Furthermore, image 
augmentation techniques are applied, incorporating Clahe, Median augmentation, and NLM augmentation. 
To enhance the predictive capability of the models, transfer learning is employed, leveraging pre-trained 
architectures including ResNet50V2, ResNet101, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, XceptionNet, and 
InceptionResNetv2. The Ensemble technique is then applied to amalgamate the strengths of individual 
models, resulting in an ensemble model with an accuracy exceeding 97%. 
The final model effectively classifies cellular images into normal and abnormal categories, providing a 
reliable tool for early detection and intervention in cases of Squamous Cell Carcinoma. The success of this 
approach underscores its potential for significant contributions to the field of medical image analysis and 
cancer diagnosis.
